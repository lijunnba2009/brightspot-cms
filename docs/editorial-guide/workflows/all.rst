Workflows
=========

With Workflows, you can see the status of a project at a glance, or track multiple editors as they contribute to separate phases of a project. You can create custom Workflows for any user role and content type. Build your own Workflows with transitions and statuses using the intuitive drag-and-drop interface that corresponds to their editorial flow.
