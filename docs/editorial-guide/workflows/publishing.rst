Workflows for Published Content
-------------------------------

Previously published content can re-enter a Workflow when a draft is saved. Click Save a Draft on published content to get the Workflow options for live content. The new draft, now in a Workflow, is referenced and accessible from the live content and, once published, replaces the live version.
