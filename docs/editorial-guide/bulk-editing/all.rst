Bulk Editing
============

Brightspot allows you to bulk edit multiple pieces of content simultaneously. With bulk editing, you can modify a list field that exists across multiple pages by adding or removing the same item. You could add a specific tag to all article content by bulk editing all existing articles and adding that tag to the tag list field. Similarly, you could remove an author from all Author lists by bulk editing all articles and removing the author from the Author field. In the case where the Author field is required, you could replace the author with a different one.

To bulk edit, choose the content to be changed by navigating to the Global Search bar and selecting filters to find the content that will be edited.

Enter full screen mode in Global Search to see more than ten search results at a time and bulk edit or export a list of results to your hard drive. You will see a list of all the content you have selected with corresponding check boxes.

Select the content to be edited by checking the boxes, and then click on the Bulk Edit Selected button at the bottom of the page.

You will be presented with a list of editing options. Click Bulk Save to save changes. Any edits made at this stage will override the existing content in the modified fields at the individual asset level.

The list of editing options corresponds with the fields associated with the content type.

There are three options when making changes to the fields associated with the content type:

* Keep: Maintains the fields as they are.
* Replace: Opens a text field, replacing the current contents of a particular field with new content.
* Clear: Deletes existing content from that field.

If the edited field a list, two additional options will be provided:

* Remove: Remove an item from the list.
* Add: Incorporate an additional item in the list.
