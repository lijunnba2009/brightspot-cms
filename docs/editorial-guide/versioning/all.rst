Versioning
==========

Brightspot stores old versions of your content, allowing you to revisit previous versions and edit them alongside the current version, or republish an older version.

The **Revisions** widget, on the right side of the Content Edit screen by default, contains a list of all previous versions of that content, organized by publish date and user.

Click on a previous verison and the Content Edit screen will split in half, showing the selected version on the left and the most current version on the right. Differences between the two versions are highlighted.

The Revisions widget highlights the version of the content that is currently selected. Clicking the 'Publish' button here will replace the current version of the content and re-publish the old version.

You can give your revision a custom name from the Publishing widget.

No saved content is ever lost. If you choose to name an older version of your content and re-publish it, overwriting the newer version, the overwritten version will stay in the Revisions widget as the most recent version.
