From the Dashboard tab, you can customize the placement of widgets to suit your workflow. Create a new Dashboard by clicking the drop-down and selecting Set. From here, you can create multiple columns to organize the widgets on your Dashboard. Click the Add buttons for the widgets you'd like to place in each column. Set the width of each column by entering a number in the Width field. Column width are relative to one another, so a column with a width of 3 is three times the width of a 1 column. To make all columns equally wide, assign them each a width of 0.

When your Dashboard configuration is complete, click Save. To restore your Dashboard to the default configuration and discard your customizations, go back to the Dashboard tab and select None instead of Set.

The Rich Text Editor is a robust word processing field used to format and style text and embed images, videos, and other supported content. It is typically used for the body text of blogs, articles, or anywhere you require complete control over the formatting and style of the published text. If you have already created content in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you can paste it directly into the Rich Text Editor and retain the original text formatting. The following settings are available for the Rich Text Editor:

Default Text Overlay CSS: Edit the default CSS styles applied when a text overlay is chosen for an image. You can alter the font properties as needed, including font size, color, etc.

Text CSS Class Groups: Add custom CSS styles for selection in the Rich Text Editor.

Legacy HTML?: Use existing HTML in the HTML editor view.

Enable Annotations?: Use annotations in the HTML editor view.

Disable Code Mirror Rich Text Editor?: Use the legacy Rich Text Editor instead of the current Code Mirror-based version.
