In the Main tab, you can edit your personal information and preferences.

Name: Set the name that will appear on content you create or edit.

Email: Set the email address to be used for notifications. If no username is provided, the email address will also be the username.

Username: The name you use to log in.

Password: Choose "Keep Same" to leave your password unchanged, or choose "Change" to set a new password.

Avatar: Set your avatar. You can choose "None," for no avatar, "New Upload," to upload a new avatar into Brightspot, or "New URL," to link to an avatar elsewhere on the internet.

Locale: Set your location and language. If you've entered an appropriate Google Server API Key in the Integrations section, Brightspot will automatically translate the UI into you chosen language using Google Translate.

Time Zone: Set your time zone.

Phone Number: Provide a phone number for text notifications.

Notify Via: Choose whether notifications should be delivered to your email or texted to your phone number.

Inline Editing: Control whether you use inline editing on all contents, only main content, or disable inline editing altogether.

From the Dashboard tab, you can customize the placement of widgets to suit your workflow. Create a new Dashboard by clicking the drop-down and selecting Set. From here, you can create multiple columns to organize the widgets on your Dashboard. Click the Add buttons for the widgets you'd like to place in each column. Set the width of each column by entering a number in the Width field. Column width are relative to one another, so a column with a width of 3 is three times the width of a 1 column. To make all columns equally wide, assign them each a width of 0.

When your Dashboard configuration is complete, click Save. To restore your Dashboard to the default configuration and discard your customizations, go back to the Dashboard tab and select None instead of Set.

The Advanced tab contains four checkboxes:

Check Return to Dashboard on Save? if you would prefer to return to the Dashboard automatically after you save your content.

Check Return to Dashboard on Workflow if you would prefer to return to the Dashboard automatically after adding your content to a Workflow.

Check Disable Navigate Away Alert? if you would prefer not to receive an alert pop-up when you leave the Content Edit page.

Check Disable Code Mirror Rich Text Editor? if you would prefer to use the legacy Rich Text Editor instead of the current Code Mirror-based version.

Two Factor Authentication
-------------------------

Brightspot offers built-in two factor authentication to help protect your account from unauthorized access. Enable the two factor authentication from the Profile box by clicking Enable Two Factor Authentication at the top. Scan the QR code using a smart phone with a service such as Google Authenticator to receive a code which you enter in the Profile box. Next, log in with your email and password credentials and the code that was received.

Use the Google Authenticator app to adjust how often the code must be entered or changed, or how long a code is valid before it times out.
