Work Streams
============

Work Streams are a powerful tool for organizing your editorial team and managing important workflows across your site. Work Streams allow you to organize content into collections based on the work that needs to be done to it, and then assign that collection to one or more editors and track th completed work on the Dashboard. For example, if you've discovered that some of your images lack proper metadata, you can use Global Search to find all images without metadata, collect them into a Work Stream, and assign a few of your editors to go through the images and add the metadata. The Work Stream will distribute the images so that your editors never waste time with conflicting edits, and will keep a dynamic count in the Dashboard widget of how many images have been corrected.

Creating a Work Stream
----------------------

To create a Work Stream, go to the Global Search window and select the content you'd like to include in the Work Stream by searching, filtering, or selecting specific content. Work Streams can also be created from a Selection. Once you've selected the content, click the New Work Stream button, give the new Work Stream a title and instructions, and assign the Work Stream to one or more users.

The new Work Stream will appear in the Work Stream widget on your Dashboard.

The Work Streams Widget

You can view and manage your Work Streams from the Work Streams widget on your Dashboard. You can filter the list of Work Streams with the two drop-down menus in the top left corner of the widget. Use the filters to find only the Work Streams assigned to you, or to check the status of Work Streams you've assigned to someone else.

Click the link that lists the number of users on a Work Stream to view a more detailed breakdown of the users assigned to the workflow, and the progress each user has made.

Using Work Streams with Workflows
---------------------------------

Create Workflows to track the progress of a project, particularly in cases where there are different contributing roles, like editors submitting content for approval and publishers approving that content. Workflows allow this process to transition smoothly from one stage to another.

Create a Workflow in the Admin > Workflows tab.

In the example above, a Workflow has been created to track the process of publishing an Article. The publishing process involves several stages, laid out in the workflow to smooth transitions. After a writer submits a draft, it has to be approved for the draft to move on to publication. If it is rejected, it must be edited and re-submitted.

Work Streams track the process and move it forward. To create a Work Stream containing all Articles in a specific status, perform a search in the Global Search Window. Search for all Articles and filter by status.

This Work Stream will now appear in the Work Streams widget in the Dashboard view.
