Production Guides
=================

Production Guides drive the direction and substance of your content and provide rules and guidelines to help the editorial staff. You can add a guide that offers production values, rules, and tips to each page, module, or content type. To create a Production Guide, go to **Admin -> Production Guides** and choose **New Guide** for one of the three types: Overall, Template/Page, or Content Type.
