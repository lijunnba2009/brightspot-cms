The Scheduled Events widget is a live calendar that tracks content scheduled to publish in the future. By default, the widgets shows scheduled changes for the upcoming week. To see the upcoming day or the upcoming month, choose from the three options in the top right corner.

You can also schedule multiple simultaneous changes across all of your content by grouping the edits together into a single Scheduled Event. You can use this feature to implement broad changes to the content of your site for a specific event, like a holiday, major news story, or product launch. Click New in the upper left corner widget to create a Scheduled Event.
