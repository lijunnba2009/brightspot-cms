The Work Streams widget allows multiple editors to work on a group of assets without conflicting. After running a Global Search, turn your search results into a Work Stream by clicking New Work Stream on the right side of the search pane. If you select specific search results with the check box to the left of the result, only the selected results will be included in the Work Stream. If no results are selected, all results will be included in the Work Stream. You can use the Work Streams widget to track completion or find other Work Streams by searching and filtering.

Delete an unwanted Work Stream by clicking its name in the Work Streams widget, and clicking Delete. For more information, please see the `Work Streams <http://www.brightspot.com/docs/3.2/editorial-support/work-streams>`_ chapter.
