The Common Content widget is your starting point for creating new content in Brightspot. The left column, "Create New," allows you to create new content quickly by clicking an item, opening a blank Content Edit screen for the chosen content type. Tailor this widget to your specific needs by going to Admin > Settings > Dashboard. You can also customize the Create Content column of the Common Content widget by clicking Customize in the upper right corner of the widget and selecting the desired content types.

The right column, "Edit Existing," contains a list of pages that are subject to frequent updates or revision. Click an item on this list to open the appropriate Content Edit pane. You can also choose specific content to keep the Edit Existing section for easy access to the content you edit the most or need to edit again in the future. To add content, click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the Common Content widget, then click "Add Item" under the ""Edit Existing" Contents" heading. Any content you select in the resulting contextual search menu will appear in the Common Content widget.
