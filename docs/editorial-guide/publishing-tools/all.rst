Publishing Tools
================

Brightspot provides everything you need to begin publishing great content. Depending on the type of content you've chosen to create, there may be variations in the elements present on the Content Edit page, but some basic features are consistently available.

To help you track the content sections you've already edited, the title box to the left of the content will change from gray to blue if you are in the process of making changes, and to yellow if the section contains unpublished changes but is not being actively edited.
