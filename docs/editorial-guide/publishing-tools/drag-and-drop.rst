Drag and Drop Content
---------------------

Content that is embedded and compatible with multiple fields on an object can be dragged and dropped between the fields, simplifying the process of arranging your content. Modules can also be dragged and dropped between containers and layouts. Brightspot knows where modules can be placed, and will only permit compatible results.
