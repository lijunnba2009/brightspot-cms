Saving Drafts
-------------

You can save unpublished content as a draft for future editing by clicking Save Draft in the Publishing widget.

You can use Global Search to retrieve saved drafts, and all saved drafts are listed in the Unpublished Drafts widget on the Dashboard. Drafts can be scheduled to publish at specified date and time, and deleting a draft will not affect the original content. For more information, please see :doc:`../publishing-process/all`.
