Required Fields
---------------

Some templates require that you complete specific fields before previewing, publishing, or saving the content as a draft. Required text fields are marked (Required), but other required fields are not marked. Click on the  toggle To check if any field is required.

Leaving any required fields blank will result in an error message when you attempt to preview or publish your content.
