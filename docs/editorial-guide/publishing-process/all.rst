Publishing Process
==================

Brightspot content moves through different phases as demanded by the publication process. The first phase is New Content, followed by Draft, Published, and finally Archived or Deleted. Content can only exist in one of these phases at a time. In addition, your content can be scheduled for later publication or passed into a Workflow. The :doc:`Revisions widget <../publishing-tools/revisions>` helps you track the changes to your content. This chapter explains the actions available to you for each content phase.
