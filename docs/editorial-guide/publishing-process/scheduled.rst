**Reschedule:** Change the time that your scheduled content will publish by choosing a new time and clicking Reschedule.

**Unschedule:** Stop previously scheduled content from publishing by clicking the Unschedule button. The draft will remain unchanged, and can be edited, published, or rescheduled normally.

**Delete Draft:** Delete scheduled drafts permanently by clicking Delete Draft. Deleted drafts are not stored in Brightspot and cannot be recovered. You will be returned to a blank Content Edit pane. To unschedule a draft without losing your content, click Unschedule instead.

**Back to Live:** If you've scheduled a draft of previously published content, you can return to the published version by clicking Back to Live, which will only appear for a revision to published content. The Revisions widget will still contain a link to the draft, but unsaved changes will be lost.
