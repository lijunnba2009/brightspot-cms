Draft
-----

Draft content has been stored in Brightspot, but is not yet live on the front end of your site. Saved draft content will not be lost if you navigate away from the Content Edit pane or close the browser tab, but unsaved edits to the draft will be lost. All drafts will be listed in the Unpublished Drafts widget.

**Publish:** When you've completed your Draft and you're ready to make it live, click Publish. The content goes live immediately.

**Save:** When you've made changes to a draft but you're not yet ready to publish it, click Save. Your changes will be stored as a new version of the draft. To see previous versions of your content, go to the Revisions widget.

**Delete Draft:** Click Delete Draft to discard a draft. You will be asked to confirm that you wish to permanently delete the draft. Deleted drafts are not recoverable. You will be returned to a blank Content Edit pane.

**Schedule:** Schedule your Draft for later publication by clicking the calendar icon next to the Publish button in the Publishing widget. Select a date and time for the content to be published to the site and click Set. The Publish button will now read Schedule. For more details, please see the Scheduling chapter.

**Back to Live:** If you've created a draft of previously published content, you can return to the published version by clicking Back to Live, which will only appear for a revision to published content. The Revisions widget will still contain a link to the draft, but unsaved changes will be lost.

**Workflow:** A Draft can be sent through a Workflow at any time. Click Submit for Approval on the Workflow tab to move your Draft to the next step in your Workflow. See the Workflows chapter for more information.
