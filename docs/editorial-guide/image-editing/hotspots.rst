Hotspots Tab
------------

Hotspots allow you to add a clickable region on your image that links to your other content or to an external website. To add a clickable Hotspot, click "Add Hotspot" beneath the image. The Hotspot will appear as a blue bullseye on the image. The Edit Hotspot menu will pop up, and you can define or edit the link for the Hotspot there. Move your Hotspot by clicking and dragging the bullseye. To remove the Hotspot, click the red X next to the blue bullseye.
