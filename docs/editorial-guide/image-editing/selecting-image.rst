Selecting an Image
------------------

To start editing an image, you can either upload a new file or locate an existing file with Search. You can also choose an image from the Edit Image interface. The drop-down box in the File section offers the following options:

* Keep Existing: Continue to work with the currently selected image.
* None: Begin to work without a selected image.
* New Upload: Upload a new image from your computer to edit.
* New URL: Type a URL into the bar to work with an already-uploaded image.
* Dropbox: Choose an image from your designated Dropbox storage, if Dropbox integration is enabled.
