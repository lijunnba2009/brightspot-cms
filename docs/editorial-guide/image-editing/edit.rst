Brightspot incorporates a suite of basic image editing tools to help you get work done without other software complicating your workflow. To edit an image, click on the Edit tab in the Edit Image interface. In this tab, you have the following tools:

**Colors:** Displays the five most common averaged colors present in the image.

**View Original:** Opens a new browser tab that displays the originally uploaded image.

**View Resized:** Opens a new menu that allows you to choose a Standard Image Size from the drop-down menu and see a preview of the cropped image. The link below the image directs to the cropped version.

**Brightness:** Changes the overall tone of the image, making it brighter (right) or darker (left).

**Contrast:** Changes the amount of difference between the light and dark areas of the image, making them more similar (left) or more different (right).

**Rotate/Flip:** From left to right, these buttons will:

* Turn the image 90 degrees counterclockwise
* Turn the image 90 degrees clockwise
* Mirror the image horizontally
* Mirror the image vertically

**Filters:** Checking one of these boxes will apply the following effect to the entire image:

* Invert: Produces a negative-like image.
* Sepia: Gives the image an amber cast.
* Grayscale: Converts the image to shades of black, white, and gray.

**Reset:** Reverts the image to the original.
