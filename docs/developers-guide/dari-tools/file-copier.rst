File Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CDN Storage for resources is referenced in the `db-storage` tool. It allows the bulk movement of `StorageItem` objects. If naming conventions dictate that a new name is defined on the objects relative to the new location, check the `Save Object` option. This results in a slower process.
